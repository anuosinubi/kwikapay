	<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
			<h5>Limitations Of Liability:</h5>
<p>By downloading or using the platform, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the platform. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the platform, any part of the platform in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the platform, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the platform into other languages, or make derivative versions. The platform itself, and all the database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Kwikapay. We are committed to ensuring that the platform is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the platform or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason of which will be clearly communicated. We will never charge you for the platform or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for through subscription options. The Kwikapay platform stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the platform secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Kwikapay platform won’t work properly or at all.</p>

<h5>Terms And Conditions:</h5>
<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Kwikapay will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the platform will require the platform to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Kwikapay cannot take responsibility for the platform not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left. If you’re using the platform outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the platform, or other third party charges. In using the platform, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the platform outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the platform, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the platform. Along the same lines, Kwikapay cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the platform i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Kwikapay cannot accept responsibility. With respect to Kwikapay’s responsibility for your use of the platform, when you’re using the platform, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Kwikapay accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the platform. At some point, we may wish to update the platform.</p>

<h5>Arbitration:</h5>
<p>You and Kwikapay agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services, shall be finally settled in binding arbitration, on an individual basis, in accordance with the Nigerian Arbitration Commision’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at https://www.nicarb.org). Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis.</p>

<h5>CLASS ACTION WAIVER:</h5>
<p>TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS WILL ONLY BE BROUGHT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND KWIKAPAY ARE EACH WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST KWIKAPAY.</p>

<h5>Changes to This Terms and Conditions:</h5>
<p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These terms and conditions are effective as of April 24, 2023.</p>

<h5>Contact Us:</h5>
<p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to contact us at support@kwikapay.com.</p>
